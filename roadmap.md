Not much here, but the game will be significantly stable to progress to 2.0.

## The Visuals Update (Version 2.x)

- Currency
- Levels
- Market
- Scrolls
- Towns
- Visuals

## The Workshop Update (Version 3.x)

The main focus is the workshop interface, but we'll throw in some more things too.

- Game Hub  
This is what the workshop will built on top of.  
Profile editing will be moved here to replace the Discord interface.  
Here you will also be able to submit screenshots, artwork (including animations), videos, guides and most importantly **scripts**. 
*More on that when we're closer to releasing it.*

- Crafting  
To compliment the release of items in 2.0, crafting will be added to give you the edge on getting collectables if you have the materials to build them.

Other things that we'll be working on for 4.0

- Language Support
- Game AI

## The Matchmaking & Tournament Update (Version 4.x)

*Note that 4.0 is not confirmed since it currently conflicts with Discord's Terms of Service. We will contact them before we go ahead with this.*

- Matchmaking
This will allow users of other communities to connect with existing games.  
*This will only work if the user wanting to join has enough guild slots on their account.*

- Tournaments
This will significantly increase the number of games allowed and how the games are run, monitored, managed, etc.

- Language Support  
As a result of Matchmaking and Tournaments being added, we will begin to support multiple languages.

- Game AI  
If a player leaves a game unexpectedly, an AI will take their place until they either die ingame or the game ends.  
*Note that if this does happen, penalties may be in the equation.*
